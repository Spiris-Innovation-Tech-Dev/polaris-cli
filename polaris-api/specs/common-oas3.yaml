    ## Description:

    The Common Object Service manages the hierarchy of software life cycle objects that are common across analytical tools. The API allows to query (and in some cases, manipulate) the following:
      * Information about the tools available to an organization.
      * Information about projects, branches, revisions, and runs the user has permission to view.


    ## Resources

    ### Tool

    A tool is a producer of issue data that is consumed by Polaris. E.g. 'Coverity 2020.03'.

    ### Application

    An application is an aggreagate of multiple projects that together make up an Application.

    ### Project

    Represents a single software product. Most often, a project is represented by a single top-level directory that contains source code and artifacts.

    ### Branch

    A branch is the same concept as a branch in source control systems, representing a set of files derived from a known starting point.

    ### Revision

    A revision is a snapshot of the project branch at a particular moment in time.

    ### Run

    A run is a single execution of a tool.

    ### Run Properties

    A run has zero or more run properties, which are attributes of the run.

    ### Project Preferences

    A user's personal setting that affects how a project's data is displayed to them in the Polaris user interface.

    ## Additional API notes

    ### Updates via PATCH requests

    Attributes and relationships of resources can be updated by sending PATCH requests.
    The payload of a PATCH request is the resource object with all attributes and relationships specified ( including the `type` but `id` is not mandatory).
    Every PATCH request must be accompanied with the latest ETag of the resource. ETags are explained in the following section.

    ### ETags

    Unless otherwise noted, all update requests (i.e. requests with the PATCH method) require the most recent ETag value to be specified in the `If-Match` HTTP
    header. This ensures the update is not applied to a stale view of the resource. Every update to a resource will also update the ETag.
    The ETag value for a resource can be found in the `meta` section of a resource.


    E.g. `If-Match: W/\"bfi8lc[...]7ekgg\"`


    When the `If-Match` header is not supplied, or an outdated ETag value is supplied, the request will fail with HTTP status `412 Precondition Failed`. The request
    can be retried by fetching the latest representation of a resource and re-issuing with the latest ETag value.

    ### Objects in trash

    Most objects in the Common Object Service are not physically deleted, just marked as `in-trash`.

    Deleting these objects are done by sending PATCH requests where the payload additionally contains the meta segment as shown below:

    ```javascript
    {
       "data": {
          "type":"resource-type",
          "attributes":{
             // All mandatory attributes
          },
          "relationships": {
             // All mandatory relationships
          },
          "meta": {
             "in-trash":true
          }
       }
    }
    ```

    When fetching many resources of a resource with an `in-trash` flag, by default only resources that are not in trash will be returned.
    The user can override this behavior by adding an `in-trash` filter to their query.
    Examples for in-trash filters and their impacts are provided for `/v0/projects` path.

    ### Asynchronous vs. synchronous API endpoints

    The `async` endpoints accept POST and PATCH requests for processing but the object state may not be up-to-date in immediately subsequent GET requests. The non-async endpoints will only return once the request has been fully processed.

    ### Recipes

    Some resources have useful queries that are too complex to be expressed with common filters. These queries have been encoded into a \"recipe\" that can be used
    by adding the `recipe` parameter and selecting one of the enumerated recipes.

    ### Testing Notes

    Note that `POST` and `PATCH` requests from this documentation page will not succeed due to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) restrictions.

            ## Batch update process
            1. If the property key does not already exist on the project, the property will be added to the project.
            2. If the property key already exists on the project and the value has not changed, the project properties will not be changed.
            3. If the property key already exists on the project and the value does not match, the property will be updated to the new value.
            4. If more than one property is provided at a time, an error will raised.
            5. A project can have a maximum of five properties. If a sixth property is attempted to be added to a project, the update to that project will fail.
            6. If the user does not have permission to update one of the projects, the update to that project will fail.
            If an update to one project fails due to the failure of one of the above conditions, other projects will still be attempted to be updated.
            **Note:**
            Unlike other endpoints, this batch endpoint does not require nor expect ETag values to be specified in the 'If-Match' header, as we are manipulating multiple projects at a time. Likewise, no ETag values are provided in the response.
            This compels users of this endpoint to ensure they have the latest representation of the objects to be updated. Requests will be processed as described above, potentially overwriting the properties set by another user.
